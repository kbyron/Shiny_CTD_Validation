  # DESCRIPTION:
  #   This function applies a weighted smoothing average to observations. Mean 
  #   for scanning window is calculated as a weighted average where observations
  #   with a greater deviation from the window mean are downweighted.
  # INPUTS:
  #   x - vector of depths associated with observation vector
  #   observations - vector of CTD data sorted by depth
  #   window - size of smoothing window, reduces model sample size by window size
  # OUTPUTS:
  #  Returns Dataframe with 4 variables:
  #    predictor - in most cases depth
  #    observations - original data values
  #    modeled.obs - estimated value for givin depth
  #    modeled.sd - standard deviation around given depth for scanning window.
